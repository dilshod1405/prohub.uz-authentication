## How to Set Up the Project  

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.  

### 1. Prerequisites  
Make sure you have the following installed:  
- **Python (version 3.12.3)**  
- **PostgreSQL (for the database)**  
- **Git (to clone the repository)**
- **RabbitMQ (message broker)**  

### 2. Clone the Repository  
First, download the project to your local machine.  
1. Open your terminal (or command prompt).  
2. Run this command:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/dilshod1405/prohub.uz-authentication.git
   cd prohub.uz-authentication
   ```  

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment  
A virtual environment keeps your project’s dependencies isolated.  
1. Run this command:  
   ```bash  
   python3 -m venv venv  
   ```  
2. Activate the virtual environment:  
   - On Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`  
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`  

### 4. Install Dependencies  
The project uses Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### 5. Configure Environment Variables  
This project uses a `.env` file to store sensitive information.  
1. Create a file named `.env` in the project folder.  
2. Add the following lines to it, replacing placeholders with your information:  
   ```env  
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  
   DEBUG=True  
   DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name  
   DATABASE_USER=your_database_user  
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password  
   DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1  
   DATABASE_PORT=5432  
   EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend  
   EMAIL_HOST=your_smtp_server  
   EMAIL_PORT=your_smtp_port  
   EMAIL_USE_TLS=True  
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@example.com  
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password
   RABBITMQ_URL=your_rabbitmq_url 
   ```

### 6. Set Up RabbitMQ  
Ensure RabbitMQ is running on your machine or server. Use the URL provided in the `.env` file to connect the service. 


### 7. Set Up the Database  
This project uses PostgreSQL.  
1. Open your PostgreSQL client or GUI tool and create a database.  
2. Use the database credentials you added to the `.env` file.  

Apply the database migrations by running:  
```bash  
python3 manage.py migrate  
```  

### 8. Start the Server  
Finally, start the development server by running:  
```bash  
python3 manage.py runserver  
```  
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## How to Use the Project  

### User Registration  
- To create a new user, send a request to the `/profile/register/` endpoint with your email and password.  
- After registration, you’ll receive an email to confirm your account. Click the link in the email to activate your profile. Use `verify-email/<uuid:verification_code>/` for confirmation new user.  

### Logging In  
- Use the `/profile/login/` endpoint to log in with your email and password. You’ll get a token that must be included in the headers of future requests.  

### Profile Management  
- View your profile: `/profile/control/{id}/`  
- Update your profile: Send updated information to the same endpoint using a PUT request.  
- Delete your profile: Send a DELETE request to the same endpoint.

### Reset Password
- Send request url to user's email to reset password via `/profile/password-reset/`.
- Confirm requesting url to reset password with `/profile/password-reset-confirm/<uidb64>/<token>/`.

### Admin Commands  
As an admin, you can manage users using custom Django commands. Run commands like this:  
```bash  
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
- Get all users list, get user by id, update, put, patch user via `/manager/update-user/` api url. Default Router is used to manage clients beacuse of its requirement of shorter code and opportunity of rest framework.

2. Use a production-ready web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI to serve the application.  
3. Configure a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache for handling incoming requests.  
4. Ensure RabbitMQ is running and reachable via the configured `RABBITMQ_URL`.
